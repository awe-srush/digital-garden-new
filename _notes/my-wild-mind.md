### I see you show interest in my endless pit of ideas and thoughts!

I know traditionally there is no concept of index for a digital garden, it is supposed to be a trail of thought that takes you from one hyperlink to another BUT we will still try to organize this chaos into a sensible one. Feel free to look at the graph down below to click on what jumps at you.

There are multiple sides to me: a software engineer, a spiritual learner, a girly girl (yes we decode skincare and makeup like the science it is), a creative video editor, a poetic writer *(take me to the lakes where all poets went to die)*, a reader, a cook (that's a new one), a fitness junkie, a foodie (trying out different cuisines? Hit me up!), a productive student of life.

The most beautiful aspect of all these different genres is that they intertwine to create abundance of confusion and chaos for me. Hence the need of a digital garden, that I will promise myself to tend to. So let's get down to it :
